Description
Spatial Stuff is a game where the player has to move the spaceShip left and right in order to avoid the spatial objects coming towards it. There is a life bar that will keep decreasing and the objective is to keep life in the life bar for the longest time possible. The player has life by crashing against special elements. The score is calculated based on the amount of time the player can survive in the game.
